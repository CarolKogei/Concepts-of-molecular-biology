## DNA  COMPOSITION
The DNA ( Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary materials found in every living organism and is usually located in the cell nucleus.It is made up of 4 chemical bases namely *Adenine, Cytosine, Thyamine & Guanine* denoted by the symbols A, C, T, G respectively which are attached to a combination of sugars and phosphates.In addition it is also characterised by a double helix structure held together by hydrogen bonds where the base pairs are formed.

>  **Nucleotides** are composed of a five-carbon sugar to which are attached one or more phosphate groups and a nitrogen-containing base.


## Difference between DNA and RNA
1.  The DNA has a double helix structure while RNA is characterised with only one strand.
2.  DNA contains sugar deoxyribose while RNA has sugar ribose.
3.  DNA is stable unde alkaline solutions while RNA is not.
4.  DNA is reponsible for storing and transfering genetic materials while RNA codes for amino acids and also as a messanger from the DNA to the ribosomes make proteins.
5.  While DNA has the base Thyamine, in RNA the same base is translated into Uracil. Uracil differs from thymine in that it lacks a methyl group on its ring.
