## DNA  COMPOSITION
The DNA ( Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary materials found in every living organism and is usually located in the cell nucleus.It is made up of 4 chemical bases namely *Adenine, Cytosine, Thyamine & Guanine* denoted by the symbols A, C, T, G respectively which are attached to a combination of sugars and phosphates.In addition it is also characterised by a double helix structure held together by hydrogen bonds where the base pairs are formed.

>  **Nucleotides** are composed of a five-carbon sugar to which are attached one or more phosphate groups and a nitrogen-containing base.

## Difference between DNA and RNA
1.  The DNA has a double helix structure while RNA is characterised with only one strand.
2.  DNA contains sugar deoxyribose while RNA has sugar ribose.
3.  DNA is stable unde alkaline solutions while RNA is not.
4.  DNA is reponsible for storing and transfering genetic materials while RNA codes for amino acids and also as a messanger from the DNA to the ribosomes make proteins.
5.  While DNA has the base Thyamine, in RNA the same base is translated into Uracil. Uracil differs from thymine in that it lacks a methyl group on its ring.

## Start and End Codons
The genetic code is made up of codons or tripple bases, in total there are 64 codons arising from combination and permutations of the 4 chemical bases. Since the genetic code is degenerate such that, more than one codon can code for a single amino acids.Therefore 61 out of the available 64 are used to code for the 20 amino  acids hence the concept of **start and end cordons**.

* **Start codons**

The most common start codon is the AUG that translates to the amino acid Methionine(Met) in eukorytes and methionine (fMet) in prokaryotes . The tRNA recognises AUG as the start codon by the help of some [initiation factors](http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/herrin/bio344/lectures/lecturespdf/Background/gSection%206.pdf) hence commencing the translation process.

Non-AUG START codons are rarely found in eukaryotic genomes. Apart from the usual Met codon, mammalian cells can also START translation with the amino acid leucine with the help of a leucyl-tRNA decoding the CUG codon. Mitochondrial genomes use AUA and AUU in humans and GUG and UUG in prokaryotes as alternate START codons.

* **End codons**

The three stop codons are namely UAG, UAA and UGA also referred by the names *ammber, opal/umber, ochre* respectively. They symbolise the end of a polypeptide chain during translation and they do not code for any amino acid therefore also known as termination or nonsense codons.

During protein synthesis, STOP codons cause the release of the new polypeptide chain from the ribosome. This occurs because there are no tRNAs with anticodons complementary to the STOP codons

> An **open reading frame** is a portion of a DNA molecule that, when translated into amino acids, contains no stop codons. The genetic code reads DNA sequences in groups of three base pairs, which means that a double-stranded DNA molecule can read in any of six possible reading frames--three in the forward direction and three in the reverse. A long open reading frame is likely part of a gene - *National Human Genome Institute*

## Amino Acids
These are the main 20 amino acids with their respective 3-letters and 1-letter codes.

## Mutations
* **What is a Mutation?**
This is simply a change in genetic sequence that may be caused by factors such as errors in DNA replication during cell division, exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to [mutagens](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mutagen) and virus infections.

> **Sponteneous mutations** are those that occur due to cell division i.e. internal factors while **Induced mutations** is a result of environmental effects such as exposure to mutagens.
> 
> **Germline mutations** occur in the reproductive cell - ovary and sperm cell - and can be passed into the offspring while **somatic mutations** occur in body cells and are not hereditary.

Gene mutations are have different effects depending on where they occur and exactly how they alter protein functions. The different type of mutations include;
* **Silent mutation:** This mutation changes the sequences of bases in a DNA but not a change in amino acids sequence of a protein.
* **Missense mutation:** It is a change in one DNA base pair resulting in a substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein made by the gene.
* **Nonsense mutation:** It is similar to the missense mutation but differ when a change in DNA sequence results in the cell prematurely stops building a protein.The resulting protein may misfunction or not function at all.
* **Insertion/Deletion mutation:** Insertion occurs when a pieace of DNA is added while deletion occurs when it is deleted. The addition or deletion  can either be a few or more base pairs, however, either way the protein doesn't function properly.
* **Duplication:** It occurs when a DNA abnormally copied one or more times resulting to alteration of the specific protein function.
* **Frameshift mutation:**   This type of mutation occurs when the addition or loss of DNA bases changes a geneâ€™s [reading frame](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/MLACourse/Original8Hour/Genetics/readingframe.html).The resulting protein is usually nonfunctional.
> Insertions, deletions, and duplications can all be frameshift mutations.
* **Repetition Expansion:** Nucleotide repeats are short DNA sequences that are repeated a number of times in a row. For example, a trinucleotide repeat is made up of 3-base- pair sequences, and a tetranucleotide repeat is made up of 4-base-pair sequences. A repeat expansion is a mutation that increases the number of times that the short DNA sequence is repeated. This type of mutation can cause the resulting protein to function in a completely different way than it would have originally.
